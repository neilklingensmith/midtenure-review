        abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) demands authentication systems which can provide both security and usability. Recent research utilizes the rich sensing capabilities of smart devices to build security schemes operating without human interaction, such as zero-interaction pairing (ZIP) and zero-interaction authentication (ZIA). Prior work proposed a number of ZIP and ZIA schemes and reported promising results. However, those schemes were often evaluated under conditions which do not reflect realistic IoT scenarios. In addition, drawing any comparison among the existing schemes is impossible due to the lack of a common public dataset and unavailability of scheme implementations.

In this paper, we address these challenges by conducting the first large-scale comparative study of ZIP and ZIA schemes, carried out under realistic conditions. We collect and release the most comprehensive dataset in the domain to date, containing over 4250 hours of audio recordings and 1 billion sensor readings from three different scenarios, and evaluate five state-of-the-art schemes based on these data. Our study reveals that the effectiveness of the existing proposals is highly dependent on the scenario they are used in. In particular, we show that these schemes are subject to error rates between 0.6\% and 52.8\%.},

abstract="Small, mobile devices without user interfaces, such as Bluetooth headsets, often need to communicate securely over wireless networks. Active attacks can only be prevented by authenticating wireless communication, which is problematic when devices do not have any a priori information about each other. We introduce a new method for device-to-device authentication by shaking devices together. This paper describes two protocols for combining cryptographic authentication techniques with known methods of accelerometer data analysis to the effect of generating authenticated, secret keys. The protocols differ in their design, one being more conservative from a security point of view, while the other allows more dynamic interactions. Three experiments are used to optimize and validate our proposed authentication method.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach to establish a secure connection between two devices by shaking them together. Instead of distributing or exchanging a key, the devices independently generate a key from the measured acceleration data by appropriate signal processing methods. Exhaustive practical experiments based on acceleration data gathered from real hardware prototypes have shown that in about 80{\%} of the cases, a common key can be successfully generated. The average entropy of these generated keys exceed 13bits.",

We aim to secure these devices by using these features in emergency scenarios. As patients can witness unpredictable lethal accidents, any implantable medical device should allow access to urgent medical interventions from legitimate parties. Any delay in providing immediate medical support can endanger the patient’s life. Hence, we propose in this work an authentication scheme that allows access to the implanted devices in emergency situations for only legitimate users. We have designed in the first place a scheme for authentication using Electrocardiogram instantaneous readings. Then, we joined the latter to a fixed biometric reading, which is fingerprint reading, to enable access to emergency medical teams. We have designed a scheme in a way to prevent attackers from accessing/hijacking the device even during emergency situations. This scheme has been assisted with elliptic curve cryptography to protect the wireless exchange of requested keys. The scheme relies on the instantaneous reading of the patient’s heartbeat and his/her fingerprint reading to create a secure key. This key will validate the authentication request of the new medical team. We have analyzed this scheme deeply to verify that they offer the necessary security for the patient’s life. We have tested if the wireless exchange of the key will expose the device’s privacy. We have also tested the accuracy of the authentication process to ensure a safe and a valid performance of the authentication process. The scheme has been designed with consideration to any hardware/software limitation that characterize any implantable medical device."

abstract = {In this paper we describe the results of our investigations Supported by EU FP7 project UNIQUE on the randomness and reliability of D flip-flops when used as a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). These D flip-flops are hardware components which present a random start-up value when powered up. We show that against all odds, enough randomness exists in such elements when implemented on an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to turn the responses of a number of D flip-flops into a secret random sequence allowing to derive keys for use in conjunction with cryptographic algorithms. In addition to being unpredictable, these flip-flops have the advantage that they can be spread over random locations in an ASIC. This makes them very difficult to reverse-engineer when used to hide a secret key in a design at a relatively small cost in resources.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) demands authentication systems which can provide both security and usability. Recent research utilizes the rich sensing capabilities of smart devices to build security schemes operating without human interaction, such as zero-interaction pairing (ZIP) and zero-interaction authentication (ZIA). Prior work proposed a number of ZIP and ZIA schemes and reported promising results. However, those schemes were often evaluated under conditions which do not reflect realistic IoT scenarios. In addition, drawing any comparison among the existing schemes is impossible due to the lack of a common public dataset and unavailability of scheme implementations.In this paper, we address these challenges by conducting the first large-scale comparative study of ZIP and ZIA schemes, carried out under realistic conditions. We collect and release the most comprehensive dataset in the domain to date, containing over 4250 hours of audio recordings and 1 billion sensor readings from three different scenarios, and evaluate five state-of-the-art schemes based on these data. Our study reveals that the effectiveness of the existing proposals is highly dependent on the scenario they are used in. In particular, we show that these schemes are subject to error rates between 0.6% and 52.8%.},

abstract = {The emergence of advanced in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems, such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, calls for fast and intuitive device pairing mechanisms to discover newly introduced devices and make or break a secure, high-bandwidth wireless connection. Current pairing schemes are tedious and lengthy as they typically require users to go through pairing and verification procedures by manually entering a predetermined or randomly generated pin on both devices. This inconvenience usually results in prolonged usage of old pins, significantly degrading the security of network connections.To address this challenge, we propose ivPair, a secure and usable device pairing protocol that extracts an identical pairing pin or fingerprint from vehicle's vibration response caused by various factors such as driver's driving pattern, vehicle type, and road conditions. Using ivPair, users can pair a mobile device equipped with an accelerometer with the vehicle's IVI system or other mobile devices by simply holding it against the vehicle's interior frame. Under realistic driving experiments with various types of vehicles and road conditions, we demonstrate that all passenger-owned devices can expect a high pairing success rate with a short pairing time, while effectively rejecting proximate adversaries attempting to pair with the target vehicle.},

abstract = {Context-based authentication is a method for transparently validating another device's legitimacy to join a network based on location. Devices can pair with one another by continuously harvesting environmental noise to generate a random key with no user involvement. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the theoretical limitations of environmental noise harvesting, making it difficult for researchers to build efficient algorithms for sampling environmental noise and distilling keys from that noise. This work explores the information-theoretic capacity of context-based authentication mechanisms to generate random bit strings from environmental noise sources with known properties. Using only mild assumptions about the source process's characteristics, we demonstrate that commonly-used bit extraction algorithms extract only about 10% of the available randomness from a source noise process. We present an efficient algorithm to improve the quality of keys generated by context-based methods and evaluate it on real key extraction hardware. MOONSHINE is a randomness distiller which is more efficient at extracting bits from an environmental entropy source than existing methods. Our techniques nearly double the quality of keys as measured by the NIST test suite, producing keys that can be used in real-world authentication scenarios.},
